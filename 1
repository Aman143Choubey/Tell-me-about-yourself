Hello ,it been amazing to hear from you , my name is aman choubey,
Recently i have completed my gradution (2021),After completing ,
i got an opportunity to work as analyst ,as i started learning discovering new tools, 
I can sum up my entire personal and professional life in three words â€“ I can win! 
My dad would vouch for the fact that I have a havoc wrecking never-say-die spirit! 
It is impossible to subdue me, no matter what.
I also make sure that this attitude becomes contagious within my team. 
Some of my colleagues say that I encourage my teammates as a football coach during crunched situations
therefore i decided enhance more in data Science,after comparing lots of Software training institute ,finally i decided to go with edyoda.
As i started learning more more  , like python ,SQL,ML etc...
